This project is a STM32L476RG based bicycle computer designed to provide cyclists with information about their ride. The device is built using TFT LCD module, Hall sensor, pressure and altitude sensor. 

## Features
* The speed measurement is performed using a Hall effect sensor, which counts the wheel rotations period through timers and interrupts to provide accurate real-time speed data
* Trip distance
* Ride time
* Altitude difference measurement is performed using the LPS25HB pressure and altitude sensor, which communicates with the microcontroller via the I2C interface.
* The TFT LCD display communicates with the microcontroller via the SPI interface(including DMA)
## Will have in the future
* EEPROM Storage: The device will include EEPROM for storing ride data and configurations
* Battery Power Supply: Due to current hardware limitations, the battery power supply feature cannot be implemented at this time
* Custom PCB Layout
* Enclosure
